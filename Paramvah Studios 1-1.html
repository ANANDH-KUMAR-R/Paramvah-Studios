    <div class="Content">
        Paramvah Studios aims to be a world class production house creating memorable films & characters using <br>
        latest technologies & best creative talents. We are a production house, engaged in creating movie content and
        <br>
        Paramvah Studios is more than just a name for us. <br><br>


        Paramvah means the first vibration. According to a legend, the Paramvah <br>
        came through Shiva's damroo, which was Om and he started dancing to <br>
        the tune when the universe was formed. The music and Shiva's dance is a <br>
        form of entertainment, which nobody has seen. The whole idea of keeping <br>
        the name Paramvah is do something out-of-the-box. <br><br>



        It encompasses the essence of our imagination, creativity and perseverance, which takes us closer to every <br>
        creative person who can work with a creative space and with complete freedom. <br>
        <br>

        For some it is projects and for few assignments, they also call it dreams; for us it is passion! It is the
        passion <br>
        that differentiates us from others. We are just a year old but inching towards completion of our first project
        <br>
        that serves as platform to many debutants (people in front of the camera and behind the camera). <br>
